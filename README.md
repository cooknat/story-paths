Approach to design and implementation

choosing the technology

designing the data structure

step by step 
  front end
  got routes working
  fiddled about with data structure - using pos or not
  initially tried showing the forms conditionally before deciding on a loop, rewrote code a couple of times to get it to do what i wanted
  spent some time on how to handle clicking on story links - whether to pass the text back as i did or use another session variable. 
  wanted to be able to use the same route for the story links or the back to the start links
  
  
learnt
 when you start debugging, carefully check syntax, spacing, brackets, ends etc first
 writing out the question you need to answer and then going away for 20 minutes often answers the question for you in your own head
 

Shortcuts
 not parsing user entries
  so avoid
percents
double quotes
leading question marks

long words don't wrap and long sentences don't scroll or resize

extra things that would be nice to do - up one level, print a random story chain, randomize the starter sentence
 

What I think this test is testing
